# PCOS-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Algorithms
My thesis work under supervision of Dr. Mohammed Nazim Uddin

The File Data_Cleaning implements various methods to properly clean the dataset of PCOS Patients.

Final_model demonstrates the use of ten machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, xgBoost, ADABoost, SVM, Naive Bayes and Voting Classifier alongside Artificial Neural Network.
